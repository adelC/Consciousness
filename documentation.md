## Objectives

* Agent dicovering a minimal self
* Interaction between perception and reflection: 
## Agent components:

### 1. Long term memory

The cocenpts learned by the agents will be stored into the long term memory. We  consider using the Semantic networks approach to store and connect the different concepts. Each learned concepts is represented by a node and those nodes are connected by links. The links might be shorter, for closely related concepts and  or loger, for less related concepts.

### 2. Short term memory (Working Memory)
It contains the concepts that are retrieved from the the Long term memory.


### 3. Perception mechanism

The angent needs to have perception mechanism to perceive the world surrounding him. At the begining, the agent doesn't know anithing about the world. We need to find a mechanism so that the agent learn new concepts (ex: self, Apple..ect) with all its features and caracteristics and store them in long term memory. if the agents see an know object, meaning that it does exist in the long-term memory, the this object(concept) will be retreived and stored in the working memory

### 4. Reflection mechanism
